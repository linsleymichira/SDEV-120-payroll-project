# How to Run the Payroll System

## Quick Start Guide

### Running the Main Program

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### When Prompted

1. **Load Test Data?**
   - Type `yes` to load 10 pre-configured test employees
   - Type `no` to start with an empty database

2. **Main Menu Options:**
   - **Option 1:** Enter Employee Data - Add individual employees manually
   - **Option 2:** View All Employee Records - Display all stored employees
   - **Option 3:** Process All Employees - Calculate payroll for everyone and save to file
   - **Option 4:** Exit - Close the program

### Running the Automated Tests

To verify the system is working correctly:

```bash
python3 run_tests.py
```

This will run 29 automated tests covering:
- Database operations
- Input validation
- Payroll calculations
- Tax calculations
- Overtime calculations
- All 10 test employee cases

### Running the Demo

To see a demonstration with all 10 test employees:

```bash
python3 demo_run.py
```

This will:
1. Load all 10 test employees
2. Process their payroll
3. Display results
4. Save to `payroll_results_demo.txt`

## Example: Enter Employee Data

When you select option 1 (Enter Employee Data), you'll be prompted:

```
Enter Employee ID (e.g., E001): E011
Enter First Name: John
Enter Last Name: Smith
Enter Number of Dependents: 2
Enter Hours Worked: 45
```

The system will:
1. Validate all inputs
2. Look up the hourly rate (or use default $15.00)
3. Calculate gross pay (with overtime if applicable)
4. Calculate taxes (State 5.6%, Federal 7.9%)
5. Calculate net pay
6. Display complete payroll results

## Example: Process All Employees

When you select option 3 (Process All Employees):

1. The system processes each employee in the database
2. Displays results for each employee
3. Saves detailed results to `payroll_results.txt`
4. Shows summary totals

## Output Files

### payroll_results.txt
Generated when you process all employees. Contains:
- Detailed payroll breakdown for each employee
- Summary totals (total gross, total tax, total net)

### payroll_results_demo.txt
Generated by the demo script. Same format as above.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses only Python standard library)

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/SDEV-120-payroll-project
```

### Invalid input errors
The system has validation for:
- Hours: 0-80 hours per week
- Dependents: 0-20
- Names: Letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes only
- Employee ID: Must not be empty

## Tips

1. **Load Test Data First**: When learning the system, start by loading test data to see how it works
2. **Run Tests**: Run `run_tests.py` to verify everything is working
3. **Try Different Scenarios**: Experiment with different hours to see overtime calculations
4. **Check Output Files**: Open the generated `.txt` files to see formatted results
